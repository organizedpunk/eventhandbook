Welcome to W3PN Paper Academy.

In the early days of the Cypherpunk movement, texts were circulated on paper during meetings… To revive this practice, the W3PN Academy becomes the Paper Academy for a day, and invites you to grab copies of such texts around the Paper Hub. These manifestos, research papers and e-mails from the Cypherpunks mailing list have been selected as they offer a glimpse of the political visions of those privacy pioneers. You’re invited to submit the title of a text that was influential in your decision to join the Web3 ecosystem, or that, at least, sparked your interest and made you join us today :) We’ll add it to the Academy resources that will soon be published online. Read, contribute, empower others and stay safe you lil’ cypherpunkhead.
